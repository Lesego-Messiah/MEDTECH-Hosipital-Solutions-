Hospital Network Infrastructure Overview
Our hospital's network infrastructure is designed to ensure seamless, reliable, and secure access to vital hospital administration software across multiple buildings. The network supports three adjacent wards, each with five storeys, and a large administration complex with five floors housing 150 practitioners. Critical network features ensure that staff members can efficiently access the central server located in the administration block from any location within the hospital, including billing areas and various wards.
